# Space-Telecommunications
School Project 2023 - Space Telecommunications


<p> During the course and in the TD, we studied the main building blocks of a digital communication system. We have three fundamental blocks: the transmitter, the channel, the receiver.

<p>
During this project, we will simulate all of them in Matlab. We performed a time and frequency domain analysis of various signals. This allows us to better understand the issues that a practitioner working in communications field has to face.</p>
