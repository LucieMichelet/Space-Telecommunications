# Space-Telecommunications
School Project 2023 - Space Telecommunications


<p> During the course and in the TD, we studied the main building blocks of a digital communication system. We have three fundamental blocks: the transmitter, the channel, the receiver.
</p>
<p>
During this project, we will simulate all of them in Matlab. We performed a time and frequency domain analysis of various signals. This allows us to better understand the issues that a practitioner working in communications field has to face.</p>

<p> In this repository you will find two files "Projet_1_Rect" and "Projet_2_RCC" that are the same matlab files but applied to two different signal, the RectPulse and the Root-Raised-Cosine. You can also find our report as a pdf, and the subject of this class.</p>
